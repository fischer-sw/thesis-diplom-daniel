Within this work a model describing the development of a reaction-diffusion-advection front within a radial reactor was created and successfully implemented in \texttt{ANSYS FLUENT}. The model validation was done using existing experimental data. After assuring that the model shows physically believable behaviour, a parameter study was done using the dimensionless variables $Pe$ and $Sc$. The variables looked at were the front positions, the front's width and the total amount of product formed.
